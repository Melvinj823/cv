                <p> <em>Senior IT Engineer </em> at <strong>Breakthru Beverage Group</strong></p>
                <p> I am a programmer that loves building automated scripts and enjoys learning new things. I have
                    worked with many
                    developers, test
                    engineers, business architects, and business users. I am also well
                    versed in all phases of the software development lifecycle and have led multiple projects as a QA
                    lead as well
                    as provided training to
                    many end users on how to use test management tools like HP ALM and Tricentis qTest. In addition to
                    my technical
                    background, I am also a very
                    determined and a highly motivated individual that gives it their all regarding to completing any
                    tasks that I
                    work on, and enjoy collaborating with others to accomplish common goals.
